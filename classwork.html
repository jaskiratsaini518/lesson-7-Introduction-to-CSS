    <h4>Halloween is a fun holiday that happens every year on October 31. Children dress up in costumes and go from door to door, collecting candy.</h4><br>

        Halloween, or Hallowe'en (less commonly known as Allhalloween, All Hallows' Eve, or All Saints' Eve), is a celebration observed in many countries on 31 October, the eve of the Western Christian feast of All Hallows' Day. It is at the beginning of the
        observance of Allhallowtide, the time in the Christian liturgical year dedicated to remembering the dead, including saints (hallows), martyrs, and all the faithful departed. In popular culture, Halloween has become a celebration of horror and
        is associated with the macabre and the supernatural.

        The word Halloween or Hallowe'en ('Saints' evening'[40]) is of Christian origin;[41][42] a term equivalent to 'All Hallows Eve' as attested in Old English.[43] The word hallowe[']en comes from the Scottish form of All Hallows' Eve (the evening before
        All Hallows' Day):[44] even is the Scots term for 'eve' or 'evening',[45] and is contracted to e'en or een;[46] (All) Hallow(s) E(v)en became Hallowe'en.

        Halloween is thought to have influences from Christian beliefs and practices.[47][23] The English word 'Halloween' comes from "All Hallows' Eve", being the evening before the Christian holy days of All Hallows' Day (All Saints' Day) on 1 November and
        All Souls' Day on 2 November.[48] Since the time of the early Church,[49] major feasts in Christianity (such as Christmas, Easter and Pentecost) had vigils that began the night before, as did the feast of All Hallows.[50][47] These three days
        are collectively called Allhallowtide, a time when Western Christians honour all saints and pray for recently departed souls who have yet to reach Heaven. Commemorations of all saints and martyrs were held by several churches on various dates,
        mostly in springtime.[51] In 4th-century Roman Edessa it was held on 13 May, and on that date in 609, Pope Boniface IV re-dedicated the Pantheon in Rome to "St Mary and all martyrs".[52] This was the date of Lemuria, an ancient Roman festival
        of the dead.[53]
